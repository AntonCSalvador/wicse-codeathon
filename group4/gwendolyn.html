            I bet you couldn't answer.  The reason why is hard to admit.  But it is very true.    The color of you personality matches the room.  The shape of your words and actions will change with the enviornment surrounding you.  In other words, you will act the way you think your friends will want you to.  There are many versions of you.  That's why it is so hard to describe yourself.  Which version are you describing?

            Say you have two friends.  One loves having fun.  The other values school and stuies.  You will probably act differently around them.  You might tell a lot of jokes to you fun-loving friend.  You likely would spend your time with the other friend studying.  You may try to deny it, but you know it's true.  This also explains why different friends have different opinions about you.  Your personality may also change over time.  You family may notice those differences.
